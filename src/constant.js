pc: `I'm a Software Engineer currently working as a Cloud Engineer, but my passion for programming remains strong. I code daily, building cool apps and exploring new ideas. These days, I mostly work with JavaScript and TypeScript, and I've even built a few games with them. Regardless of the language, I just love writing code.  
Check out my <a href="https://github.com/mofach90" target="_blank">GitHub</a>!`,

"cs-degree": `This is my Computer Science degree. I keep it on display because it represents a solid foundation in theory and problem-solving that continues to support my work today.`,

"sofa-table": `This is where I unwind and dive into YouTube or brainstorm new project ideas.`,
tv: `That's my TV. Lately, I’ve been deep into watching tech YouTubers like

  Always inspiring and fun to watch.`,
bed: `This is where I sleep. Funny enough, some of my best ideas hit me when I'm lying here. 
  If I don't jot them down right away, I can’t sleep — they keep spinning in my head, demanding attention.`,
resume: `This is my desk and on it is my resume.

library: `There are a lot of programming books on my shelves. There is even one in French (I also speak French btw).
I probably only read one of them. Who else compulsively buys technical books without ever finishing them?`,
